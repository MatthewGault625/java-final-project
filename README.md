# java-final-project
CSCI 3326 | The final project that we worked on as a group for our Object Oriented Programming in Java course in which we created a Brick Breaker Game using Java and MySQL database. The Brick Breaker Game displaysa login screen for the user to create an account or sign in with an existing account forwhich to store their game score and account information using the MySQL database. The Brick Breaker Game is a standard game that the user controls the paddle on a horizontal axis and you get pointsby hitting the bouncing ball off the paddle and breaking the bricks above the paddle. This program can be run in Eclipse or other IDEs that support Java and MySQL.
